# Conway's Game of Life

This repository contains my implementation of Conway's Game of Life using pygame. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation where cells evolve based on simple rules.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/clifforc/game_of_life
   cd game_of_life
   ```

2. Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

Run the game by executing the `main.py` file:

```
python main.py
```

### Controls

- `Left mouse button`: set cells;
- `Spacebar`: pause/resume game;
- `c`: clear the grid;
- `q`: quit the game.

## TODO List

- [ ] Refactor the codebase to follow Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles;
- [ ] Create a menu system for adjusting game settings;
- [ ] Add different initial patterns.
